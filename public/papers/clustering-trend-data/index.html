    <h3>Abstract</h3>
    <p>When we are given trend data for different keywords, scientists may want to cluster them in order to detect specific terms which exhibit a similar trending. For this purpose the periodic regression on each of the time-series can be performed. We ask in this work: What if we not simply cluster the regression models of each time-series, but the periodic signal constituents? The impact of such an approach is twofold: first we would see at a regression level how similar or dissimilar two timeseries are regarding their periodic models, and secondly we would be able to see similarities based on single signal constituents between different time-series, containing the semantic that although time-series may be different on a regression level, they may be similar on an constituent level, reflecting other periodic influences. The results of this approach reveal commonalities between time series on a constituent level that are not visible in first place, by looking at their plain regression models.</p>
