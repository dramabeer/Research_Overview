I am a post-doctoral researcher in Data Mining and Machine Learning at the University of Vienna. I received my PhD degree in Computer Science from LMU Munich for my work
"On the Edges of Clustering - Creating Synergies with Related Problems", 
supervised by Prof. Dr. Thomas Seidl. <br>
Before my current position, I was working on data analysis methods for molecular dynamics data as a post-doc at Aarhus University, Denmark. <br>

Research Interests: <br>
Unsupervised Machine Learning <br>
Density-based Clustering <br>
Evaluation of AI Methods
