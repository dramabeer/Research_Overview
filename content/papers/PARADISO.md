abstract = "Many algorithms have been developed for detecting clusters of various kinds over the past decades. However, just few attempts have been made to provide an interactive setting for the clustering algorithms. In this paper, we present PARADISO, an interactive Mean Shift method. It enables the user to get back to any arbitrary iteration point of the run observing the evolution of the clusters after each iteration and to set different bandwidth parameters. The user gets a clustering result with this method which emerged through multiple bandwidths while the user can see the full chain of effects of the chosen bandwidths over all iterations. Further, our method provides so-called Points-Shifted-Distance plots (PSD plots) for the Mean Shift algorithm which aim to facilitate the choice of a different bandwidth for the user. Beyond the mentioned features, PARADISO provides a visualization method which lets the user see the different bandwidth choices made in form of pathways."
