abstract = "MORe++ is a k-Means based Outlier Removal method working on high dimensional data. It is simple, efficient and scalable. The core idea is to find local outliers by examining the points of different k-Means clusters separately. Like that, one-dimensional projections of the data become meaningful and allow to find one-dimensional outliers easily, which else would be hidden by points of other clusters. MORe++ does not need any additional input parameters than the number of clusters k used for k-Means, and delivers an intuitively accessible degree of outlierness. In extensive experiments it performed well compared to k-Means-- and ORC."
